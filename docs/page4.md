# Zebroid Group Meetings: A New Chapter (9/24/21) 

Starting in Fall 2021, we are reviving the Zebroid group meeting. Today (9/24/21) we will have an organizational meeting to discuss the format, content, and intention of having these group meetings.  

## Motivations 

Over the course of the past year, I have seen that meetings are a lot easier when it's explicitly clear to me what I'm getting out of the meeting before I even start. What do we each individually want to get out of a group meeting?   

My personal list: 

- Social interaction with people who share my interests 
- Discussion/help for new ideas 
- Feedback on current project progress 
- Developing a new skill  
- Building a shared knowledge base  

*[Will be replaced by whole group list will go here after meeting]*

## Implementing motivations 

With a shared set of motivations in hand, how can we make plans for a group meeting that support these motivations? 

- Social interaction with people who share my interests 
    - In person lunches?  
    - Field trips 
- Discussion/help for new ideas 
    - Semi-regular project updates 
- Feedback on current project progress 
    - Larger format presentations before a talk 
- Developing a new skill  
    - Group hackathons  
- Building a shared knowledge base  
    - Journal Club 
    - Paper blog 
    - Documenting interesting papers, packages, in a shared repository 
    - Building out this repo to encompass practical implementation of software best practices in daily work. 

*[Will be replaced with whole group list after meeting]*


## Logistics 

Things we have to figure out for sure: 

- When/How often should we meet? 

- Zoom, or in person? With zoom option? 

- What is the topic/format of our next meeting?
